Screen readers, such as iOS VoiceOver, are essential tools for users with visual impairments, providing auditory feedback and allowing them to interact with digital content. <!--more-->

### What is iOS VoiceOver?
VoiceOver is Apple's built-in screen reader for iPhones and iPads. It reads on-screen elements aloud, allowing users to navigate using gestures and auditory feedback. Users can enable VoiceOver in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver or via Siri by saying, "Turn on VoiceOver." 

### Using sr-only for Hidden from everyone but Screen Readers
Sometimes, you may want to hide a label to maintain a clean design while still ensuring that screen readers can interpret the label correctly for users who rely on them.

In this example, you have a form with a text area for submitting comments. You want to hide the label "Comment" from the visual layout while still making it available to screen readers.

Here's an example where a label is hidden visually but still accessible to screen readers, using Tailwind CSS's sr-only class.

```html
<InputLabel for="body" class="sr-only">Comment</InputLabel>
<TextArea id="body" v-model="commentForm.body" rows="4" placeholder="Speak your mind Spock…"/>
```
This approach maintains a clean, minimal design while ensuring that screen reader users can understand the purpose of the input field. It’s a great solution for creating accessible and visually appealing forms without compromising usability.
