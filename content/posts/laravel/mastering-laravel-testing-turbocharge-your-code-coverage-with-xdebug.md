In the dynamic world of Laravel development, ensuring your code is well-tested isn't just good practice; it's essential for creating robust applications. **Code coverage** serves as a critical metric to assess the extent to which your tests cover your codebase. <!--more-->

This guide will walk you through setting up Xdebug for code coverage in Laravel, along with troubleshooting common issues. When you first attempt to run:

```sh
php artisan test --coverage
```

you might encounter an error like:
ERROR  Code coverage driver not available. Did you set Xdebug's coverage mode?

This indicates that Xdebug might not be installed or configured correctly for coverage analysis.

```php
Route::get('/test', function () {
    phpinfo();
    return 'test';
});
```

Visit /test in your browser and look for Xdebug details.

Navigate to [Xdebug Wizard](https://xdebug.org/wizard)
Paste the phpinfo() output into the wizard for analysis to ensure Xdebug is correctly installed.

If it's installed locate the php.ini by searching for it in the html output. 

### Editing php.ini with vim
```sh
sudo nano /path/to/your/php.ini
```

Add or modify the following lines:
```ini
xdebug.mode = debug,coverage
xdebug.start_with_request = yes
```

### Running Code Coverage Again

Now, execute:
```sh
php artisan test --coverage
```

This should now work, providing coverage statistics.
