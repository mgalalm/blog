Testing Exceptions. In this post, we'll explore how to create and test custom exceptions effectively, enhancing the reliability of your applications.

### Why Custom Exceptions?
Using a custom exception, like OrderNotFoundException, instead of general exceptions (Exception, RuntimeException, etc.), provides several benefits:

- Specificity: It clearly communicates what went wrong, making debugging and error handling more precise.
- Organization: Custom exceptions help in organizing your application's error handling logic. You can define specific behaviors or additional data for each type of exception.
- Code Readability: When someone reads or works with your code, custom exceptions immediately convey the context of errors, improving code clarity.

### Creating Custom Exceptions
First, create a custom exception:

```php
php artisan make:Exception OrderNotFoundException
```

This command generates a new exception class in the app/Exceptions directory.

Modify OrderNotFoundException.php


```php
<?php

namespace App\Exceptions;

use Exception;

class OrderNotFoundException extends Exception
{
    /**
     * Render the exception into an HTTP response.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function render($request)
    {
        return response()->json(['error' => 'Order not found'], 404);
    }
}
```

### Testing Exceptions with PEST
When testing for non-custom exceptions, Laravel's PHPUnit integration allows you to use `expectException` to anticipate exceptions:

```php
/** @test */
public function it_throws_an_invalid_argument_exception()
{
    $this->expectException(\InvalidArgumentException::class);

    // Code that should throw the exception
    $this->withoutExceptionHandling()->get('/invalid-route');
}
```
Make sure to place $this->expectException() at the start of your test to signal Pest about the expected exception, not after the failing code.

### Test Exception Messages: 

You can also check the message of the exception using `expectExceptionMessage`:

```php
$this->expectExceptionMessage('Order with ID 123456789 does not exist');
```

## Conclusion
- Testing exceptions with Pest in Laravel enhances your application's reliability and user experience. By employing Pest's clear syntax and Laravel's testing features, you can:

- Ensure Robust Error Handling: Verify that your application responds correctly to errors.
Improve Code Quality: Use specific exceptions for better code clarity and maintenance.
Enhance User Experience: Deliver informative feedback in case of errors.

- Remember, exceptions serve as signals for specific conditions within your application. Testing these with Pest ensures your application remains robust against unexpected scenarios.
